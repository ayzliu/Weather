# Weather Forecast App

The Weather Forecast App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any location they choose. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, it displays current weather conditions, including temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating the use of async/await for API requests and dynamic updating of the DOM based on fetched data.
